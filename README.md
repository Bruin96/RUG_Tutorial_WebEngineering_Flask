# Flask Tutorial

This repository describes a basic tutorial for getting started with Flask that was given during the course Web Engineering at the University of Groningen. The code is made available publicly so that students can use the demo program to try out Flask and see if it is a framework they would want to work with. This code has not been tested enough to be used directly in professional settings without extensive modifications. Furthermore, his tutorial will leave out some setup steps that would be important in professional implementations.
